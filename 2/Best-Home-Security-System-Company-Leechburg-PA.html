<p>You would be hard-pressed to discriminate between 1080p and 4K resolution when taking a look at a normal camera image. The one significant advantage of 4K resolution is the ability to deal with information after the truth, which implies that users can focus on details such as faces while the recording of a security event plays. However, while 4K resolution provides some advantages, it likewise brings with it some disadvantages. 4K images are very large and use up a lot of tape-recording storage area.
