Hard disk storage is safe, secure, and practical, with many systems using expansion and free cloud storage, such as Arlo Pro 2 Wireless Home Security System. Where does the video feed go? Does the camera store to an SD card, which you'll require to manually get rid of to transfer the data? Does it go to your smart device, or upload to services like Dropbox? For the greatest security, you want the data to be supported in numerous places. Another element is the number of days of video footage are archived.

Night vision holds true 1080p at around 40ft, but still can see pretty good after that. These cameras are what you require to buy, and do not go cheap.</p>
