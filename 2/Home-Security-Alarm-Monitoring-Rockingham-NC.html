<p>I just ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to modify the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very crucial function. Also great metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big choice device into the wall. Must be a much better way to carry out that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness during the night. Ideally these hold up over the years! Highly recommend.</p>
