<p>Thanks to recent advancements in technology, wireless security systems are now as reliable as wired systems If you've made the decision to install a burglar alarm, you need to consider the following benefits of wireless technology. The $260 Essentials bundle includes the base station, a keypad, 4 entry sensors, one motion sensor, a backyard sign, and 2 window decals. For $15 each month, you can add ongoing professional monitoring and a cellular connection, so the system can interact with the monitoring service without a landline. The $25-per-month Interactive plan adds control through iOS and Android mobile phone apps, push and e-mail notifies, and 30-day event-footage storage for endless cameras, including the SimpliSafe Video Doorbell Pro, which is offered individually. Without the $25 plan, you deal with all controls through the keypad.</p>

Systems based around an NVR are a lot easier to scale up than DVR systems, just since they can accept a new camera once it is contributed to the network. In the worst case, all that would be required is an extra PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can send video footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no proximity constraints so long as a camera is connected to the same network as the NVR. The biggest downside to an NVR system, nevertheless, is that not every IP camera will work with every NVR.
