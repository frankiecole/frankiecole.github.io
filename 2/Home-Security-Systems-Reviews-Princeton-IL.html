<p>Three huge advantages of wireless security systems for renters are their mobility, impermanence and expandability. Occupants, unlike property owners, generally avoid making irreversible modifications to their homes. Hardwired security systems for that reason aren't practical; they include drilling into walls and installing irreversible electrical circuits. On the other hand, wireless security uses equipment that's either freestanding or attached to walls and entranceways with detachable adhesive. Wireless control panels, sensors and other components can quickly be set up at different properties later on, and wireless systems are easily expanded with new components too. Wireless security strategies also allow remote control of the system and basic home automation.
