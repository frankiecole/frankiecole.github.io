If the system was not set up during the homebuilding process, setting one up might need drilling holes into walls, running new wires, covering drywall and gaining access to challenging spots that are sealed in attics or basements. Wired security systems are also vulnerable to power blackouts. Many will have a backup battery system that switches on in case of an interruption, but long term outages will lead to the system losing power.
