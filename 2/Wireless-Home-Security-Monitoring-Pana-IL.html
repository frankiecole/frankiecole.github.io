<p>The Nest Web cam IQ Outdoor streams 1080p video with the very same membership model and very same app as the original Nest Webcam Outdoor, however it includes more-detailed individual detection, a brighter image, an automated close-up tracking function (which follows an individual around the viewing area), much better audio, a stronger install, and a larger operating temperature level range (-40 degrees Fahrenheit to 113 degrees Fahrenheit).
