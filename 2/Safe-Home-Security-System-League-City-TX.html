<p>Unlike the majority of other cameras we tested, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ). Instead, you can filter event notifications just by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is available just with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more alerts, which you can just filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. The membership is more useful when utilized in high-traffic locations. Otherwise, the Smart Location feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid signals each time you stroll by. Strangely, though the app supports multiple users, its geofencing applies to each user separately, so if everyone in your household has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notices when other people are home.</p>
