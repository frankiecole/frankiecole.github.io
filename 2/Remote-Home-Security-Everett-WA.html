We like that the system consists of a wifi security camera and just notifies you when motion is developed by something with the same heat pattern as a human (ensuring there's no incorrect signals). Nevertheless, you do require to sign up for the external monitoring service (from ₤ 12.99 each month) to be able to see recording from the wifi security camera and get signals on your phone if the sensors have been activated.

If this occurs, call your existing monitoring company to confirm. Usually, you would be notified of a change like this by mail or telephone, not by an unannounced see by an agent from another company.</p>
