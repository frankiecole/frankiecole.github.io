<p>The Canary is one of the largest cameras we checked, and it provides two-way communication with its paid Canary Membership. The cost of the Canary View makes the size a bit more palatable, however the image isn't as sharp, and recording wasn't consistent during our testing. The Netatmo Welcome doesn't have two-way audio or digital zoom, and it continuously asked us to acknowledge already-identified faces. And regardless of having an attractive cost and good performance, the Yi 1080p Home Camera has complicated cloud storage that adds $65 to $150 each year to the cost of an otherwise spending plan camera.</p>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not excellent-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the rate of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching.

Likewise, the Pro 3 offers no free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, only through a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we found to have awful night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far too many motion activates.</p>
