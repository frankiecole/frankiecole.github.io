Watch on what matters by streaming your security camera on your TV utilizing Google Nest or Home speaker or screen and Chromecast or a TV with Chromecast built-in.</p>
<p>I just completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial function. Likewise good metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge choice gadget into the wall. Should be a better method to carry out that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity in the evening. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Highly suggest.</p>
