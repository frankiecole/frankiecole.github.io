Here is what this means, by method of an example. Assume two cameras, one a basic camera with a 130 ° field of view and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) models. This indicates the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is starting with the exact same image sensor, 10MP in this case, though it has to spread out that image throughout a far bigger space and for that reason will not look as crisp of a camera that only has a 130 ° field of view.</p>

<p>A wired security system was the first kind of security system that was invented for homeowners. It needs to be installed by a professional alarm installation team and, once set up, is tough to move from one location to another. Wired systems are more common for big properties and are often more expensive than a wireless home security system. They can consist of outdoor cameras and an indoor camera just like the wireless system. In order to install the hardwired security system, the team will need to revamp the existing wires in your house. The group will be able to recycle the existing electrical wiring if you have actually currently installed a wired system in the past and you are upgrading to a new system. However, if this is your very first system, the alarm installation process can take upwards of three hours.</p>
