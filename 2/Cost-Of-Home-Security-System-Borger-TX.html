The normal factor for carrying out a DoS attack is to observe the healing of the wireless network, throughout which all of the initial handshake codes are re-transmitted by all gadgets, offering a chance for the destructive enemy to tape-record these codes and use numerous breaking tools to evaluate security weak points and exploit them to gain unapproved access to the system. This works best on weakly encrypted systems such as WEP, where there are a variety of tools readily available which can introduce a dictionary style attack of "possibly accepted" security secrets based upon the "design" security essential captured throughout the network recovery.</p>
