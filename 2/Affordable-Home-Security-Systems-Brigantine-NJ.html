<h3>Wireless Camera Security System Brigantine NJ 08203</h3>
<p>Blink cameras are compact, consist of totally free storage, and utilize 2 AA batteries that can last as much as 2 years. However, to save that battery power, recordings max out at just 10 seconds, with the system leaving a gap of in between 12 seconds and 35 seconds from one clip to the next.

<p>Neither the camera nor the light is particularly excellent by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's just 720p-- and we're starting to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that said, we would not recommend this system to tech-lovers, as we think the functions are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home functions.
