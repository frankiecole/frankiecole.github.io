<p>Arlo develops great home security cameras, and this third-generation Arlo Pro is a prime example of what this company is capable of. While it does not have the eye-popping 4K resolution of the Arlo Ultra, it delivers great video quality and many of that more-expensive camera's other signature features for less. And it can be released inside or out. The Brinks Home Security system comes in 2 bundle choices. The Home Total design is $29 monthly. For those who want to use higher-end functions such as Live Video Streaming and Cloud Video Storage, the regular monthly charge is $39.</p>
<p>Neither the camera nor the light is particularly excellent on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's just 720p-- and we're starting to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that stated, we wouldn't recommend this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the features are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home functions. However if easy DIY installation, no-contracts, and inexpensive monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll enjoy SimpliSafe.</p>
