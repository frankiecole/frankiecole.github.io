<h3>Wireless Home Security Companies in California</h3>
<p>Surveillance systems present police "bad apples" with an appealing opportunity for criminal abuse. In 1997, for example, a top-level police official in Washington, DC was caught using police databases to gather information on customers of a gay club. By looking up the license plate numbers of cars parked at the club and investigating the backgrounds of the automobiles' owners, he attempted to blackmail customers who were married. Envision what somebody like that could do with a citywide spy-camera system.</p>
