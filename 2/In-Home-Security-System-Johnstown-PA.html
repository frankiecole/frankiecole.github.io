<p>I simply completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important function. Also great metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection gadget into the wall. Need to be a better method to carry out that. However it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness during the night. Ideally these hold up over the years! Extremely advise.</p>

This suggests the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is starting with the same image sensing unit, 10MP in this case, though it has to spread out that image throughout a far larger space and for that reason will not look as crisp of a camera that just has a 130 ° field of view.</p>
