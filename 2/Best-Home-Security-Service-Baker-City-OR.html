<p>Closed circuit tv (CCTV) surveillance is a type of situational criminal activity prevention designed to avoid both personal and residential or commercial property crime and can be used in place of, or in addition to, police. Public surveillance cameras monitor, record, and transmit images of a specific location of interest and are either monitored from another location by security personnel or preprogramed to scan the defined area (La Vigne et al. 2011). It is believed that the increased surveillance offered by CCTV will lower crime and increase arrest, without displacing criminal activity to other close-by areas where CCTV is not in usage (Ratcliffe 2009).</p>
