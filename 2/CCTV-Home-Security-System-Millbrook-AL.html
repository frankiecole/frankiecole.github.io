Siren A number of one-box systems like Canary and Somfy feature an extremely loud integrated siren that should hopefully scare off burglars (or next door's cat). Anticipate to see more sirens, both indoor and out, over the coming year as the smart brand names expand their varieties.</p>
<p>Canary has actually got over some initial software application issues to provide an extremely decent security camera option: particularly that crisp 1080p video, with a 147-degree field of vision, night vision and motion signals (plus clear audio).

<p>We have actually long been fans of the Netatmo Welcome camera (₤ 199), with its understated looks and face recognition software application.

But Netatmo has broadened its security variety with a brilliant outdoor camera and security light, the Existence (₤ 249.99), and a 3 pack of weatherproof doors and window sensing units referred to as Tags (₤ 89.99).
