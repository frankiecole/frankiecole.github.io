<p>Although 360 ° and 720 ° cameras might have the same resolution spec as that of a standard IP camera, that resolution is being spread over a much broader area and for that reason offers fewer pixels per inch. Here is what this means, by way of an example. Assume two cameras, one a standard camera with a 130 ° field of vision and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) designs. This means the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is beginning with the exact same image sensor, 10MP in this case, though it has to spread that image across a far larger space and therefore will not look as crisp of a camera that just has a 130 ° field of vision.</p>
<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with an unique light-handling function.

As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks completely typical because the doorway and space seem at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of recording video of everyone getting in the shop. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras.
