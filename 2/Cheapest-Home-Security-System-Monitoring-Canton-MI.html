<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with an unique light-handling function. These cameras use both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the entrance and then combines the 2 images together to create a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 areas. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks completely regular since the doorway and room seem at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of catching video of everyone getting in the store. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras.
