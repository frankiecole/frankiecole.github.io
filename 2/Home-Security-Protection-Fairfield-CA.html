We have actually seen 1-year, all the method approximately 5-year contracts! On the other hand, we advise contract-free systems if you don't wish to sign on the dotted line and be locked into a long-term agreement (and who does?). Our choice: No contract.</p>

Most of your commercial security cameras include dry contact input ports to integrate alarms and informs, sensors, gain access to control, and so on.
