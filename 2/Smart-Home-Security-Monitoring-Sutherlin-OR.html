<p>The Canary is one of the biggest cameras we checked, and it uses two-way communication with its paid Canary Membership. The price of the Canary View makes the size a bit more tasty, however the image isn't as sharp, and recording wasn't consistent throughout our testing. The Netatmo Welcome does not have two-way audio or digital zoom, and it continuously asked us to recognize already-identified faces. And regardless of having an attractive price and good performance, the Yi 1080p Home Camera has confusing cloud storage that adds $65 to $150 annually to the cost of an otherwise spending plan camera.</p>
