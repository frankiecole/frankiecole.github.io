We have actually found good deals here on SimpliSafe and Amcrest systems, but you'll find more than 30 brands offered. In some cases you do not have a choice. High-end home security companies like Vivint and ADT offer just professional installation. However most other companies on our best home security systems list provide you a Do It Yourself choice. ADT does not have the strongest customer service credibility among the companies we considered, racking up more than 3,000 complaints on its Better Business Bureau page While we chalked the majority of this as much as the fact that ADT has a number of million more clients than its competitors, our tester began his call with low expectations.</p>
