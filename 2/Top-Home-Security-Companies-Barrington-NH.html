<p>Just purchased a bullet ip system and absolutely love it. Terrific clarity. I wished to establish viewing on my mobile phone but had a couple concerns that the tech responded to with ease. I Would definitely purchase from cctvsecuritypros again. I highly suggest this company. The Nest Aware service is what makes this camera stick out-- it's what supplies the video history and smarter informs, for instance. However, those functions come at a relatively high cost: $5 each month ($50 per year) for the very first camera for 5 days of video history, $10 per month ($100 annually) for 10 days of video history, or $30 per month ($300 per year) for 1 month of video history.

Recordings are caught as 10-second clips that are saved for up to 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 month-to-month charge (or $80 per year) to keep 30-second clips for thirty days. Beyond those limitations, we often discovered action missing, thanks to inconsistent and prolonged spaces in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets exceptionally hot.</p>
<p>We searched for Do It Yourself systems that provided professional monitoring, both with and without a contract. Although some companies offer greatly discounted or complimentary hardware in exchange for a service commitment that can last anywhere from one to 5 years, we found no-contract systems to be the most versatile. Some individuals might want to sign up for service just for when they or their partner is out of town, for example. No-contract systems also cost less in the long run and permit you to be in overall control of the equipment you use, in addition to how and when you use and pay for monitoring services.</p>
