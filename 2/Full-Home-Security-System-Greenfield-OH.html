<p>Note: The above CCTV camera types only touch the IP camera world and overlook the old analog cameras, considered that everyone favors IP cameras today for their economical prices, features and simple setup. IP cameras primarily use security camera wire kinds of Cat5 or Cat6, or perhaps NO wires at all.
