Although theft remains one of the most often reported criminal activities, the clearance rate for U.S. break-ins has remained below 15 percent for several years. 14 Clearly, whatever contribution burglar alarms are making to solving break-in cases is modest, at best. Some wise alarms include or can be used with wifi security cameras from the exact same manufacturer.

<p>A good expert alarm monitoring company will have quick response times, which is important for your safety and security.

As soon as the cameras were connected, we monitored day and night activities, including the comings and goings of two grownups, one child, and a pet. In our testing, we paid specific attention to tape-recording quality and length, frequency of alerts, the app user interface, geofencing, and smart-home combination.</p>
<p>Neither the camera nor the light is especially impressive on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's just 720p-- and we're starting to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that said, we wouldn't suggest this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the features are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home features. But if easy Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and affordable monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll enjoy SimpliSafe.</p>
