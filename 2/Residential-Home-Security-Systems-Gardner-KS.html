<p>Research studies show surveillance cameras minimize crime. HD CCTV systems work with conventional analog CCTV cameras. If you bought cameras before 2010 or if you have coax cable television (look at the cord behind the TELEVISION that goes to the cable television box) in your existing security system that indicates you have standard analog CCTV security cameras.
