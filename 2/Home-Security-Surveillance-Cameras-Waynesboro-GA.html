<h2>Wireless Surveillance System VS Wired Cameras Waynesboro</h2>
<p>There's a lot that goes into a normal CCTV video surveillance system. While the cameras get the majority of the attention in the start, you also have other concerns, such as viewing, recording, and archiving the video footage, and the equipment required for performing those tasks. Here's a look at the basic elements of a typical CCTV system. We have a CCTV Security Pros IP Camera & NVR system at our church. We started with 16 cameras & have grown to 25 cameras.

In addition, these systems are temporarily wired into your house, so they are ideal if you're leasing or plan to take them with you when you move. They can even be set up in houses with ease.</p>

<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with a special light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the doorway and after that integrates the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 areas. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks completely normal given that the doorway and room seem at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of catching video of everybody entering the shop. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Sadly, when clients recognize that the affordable consumer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's generally far too late considering that the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
