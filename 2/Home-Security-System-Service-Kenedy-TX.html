<p>Complete the kind and a Protection 1 or ADT Specialist will call you, from time to time, about Protection 1, ADT and Lifeshield offers. You could invest a comparable quantity for the very best home security system, but they do not monitor your cameras as proactively as Deep Guard. However, they're the best home security cameras if you're searching for active monitoring. One important exception: ADT has a landline monitoring plan that's $36.99 monthly, which might be an inexpensive alternative for clients in rural areas. We suggest cellular systems due to the fact that they're much more secure than landline systems, but there are some places where cellular monitoring isn't readily available.
