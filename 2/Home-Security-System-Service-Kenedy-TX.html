You could invest a comparable quantity for the very best home security system, but they do not monitor your cameras as proactively as Deep Guard. However, they're the best home security cameras if you're searching for active monitoring. One important exception: ADT has a landline monitoring plan that's $36.99 monthly, which might be an inexpensive alternative for clients in rural areas.
