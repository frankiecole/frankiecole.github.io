<p>So, while alarm systems might have some benefit for alarm owners as part of a general security plan, the concern remains whether non-alarm owners in the community should carry a share of the cost. If alarm use resulted in enhanced public safety-- that is, alarms led to much greater burglar apprehension rates or, preferably, fewer break-ins across a whole jurisdiction-- its public value would be more obvious. Nevertheless, the truth that alarm calls are extremely incorrect and do not contribute considerably to authorities ability to apprehend robbers makes the underwriting of alarm action by police and entire communities (all taxpayers subsidize authorities reaction to alarmed properties) a ineffective and expensive method to theft reduction across a whole jurisdiction.</p>
