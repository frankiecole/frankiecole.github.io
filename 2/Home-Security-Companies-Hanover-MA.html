<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with a special light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the doorway and then integrates the two images together to create a properly-exposed composite image of the two areas. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks totally normal given that the entrance and room seem at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of catching video of everyone entering the shop. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras.
