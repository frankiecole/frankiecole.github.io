<p>I simply finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to tweak the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this very essential function. Also nice metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge selection device into the wall. Should be a better method to implement that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity in the evening. Ideally these hold up for many years! Highly advise.</p>
