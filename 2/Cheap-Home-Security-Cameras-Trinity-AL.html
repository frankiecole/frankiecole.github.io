<p>Another essential topic to talk about is camera resolution. It can be confusing to comprehend how much is enough. In this short article, the term resolution" describes the variety of dots (pixels) that comprise a video image; the more dots, the more in-depth the video image. The very same is true of high-resolution TV sets, and the two most popular TELEVISION resolutions today are 1080p and 4K. 4K resolution includes about four times as much image details as 1080p. Surveillance cameras are likewise produced in these two resolutions, and it would be natural to think that the more dots in your video image the much better, right? Yes and no. There are some difficult consequences to having such a high-resolution 4K image when it comes to surveillance cameras. In this case, more is not constantly better.</p>
