IP cameras that are linked to the same network, generally by method of a PoE switch, are then able to transmit video footage to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are a lot easier to scale up than DVR systems, merely because they can accept a new camera once it is added to the network. In the worst case, all that would be needed is an extra PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can transmit video footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no proximity constraints so long as a camera is linked to the exact same network as the NVR. The largest drawback to an NVR system, nevertheless, is that not every IP camera will work with every NVR. So you'll require to understand whether your cameras will work with a given video recorder before purchasing.</p>
