Where some choices, like ADT, have good equipment however so-so cameras, Vivint's cameras have some of the very best functions on the marketplace, including video analytics and 4K image sensors (in addition to more standard fare like motion detectors, two-way audio, and night vision).</p>
<p>The Hive View delivers excellent 1080p images day and night, but the motion activation activated too easily, even when on the most affordable level of sensitivity setting. Since this camera has no native geofencing features, you need to by hand stop notices (and recording, because it does that even when notices are off). We also experienced above-average connectivity problems, with two Hive test systems disconnecting eight times over 2 months.

However, in our tests the familiar-face informs worked only about half of the camera and the time consistently detached from the network numerous times a day (when everything else on our network seemed fine).
