<h3>Home Wireless Security Systems in Charlotte NC</h3>
<p>Unlike standard burglar alarms, which have a control board (typically situated in the entryway hall) that is used to arm and deactivate the alarm and alert you if any sensors have been activated, clever alarms are controlled from a smartphone app. The app lets you arm and deactivate the alarm, even if you have actually currently left home, and notifies you if any of the sensing units have been activated, rather than getting home to discover your siren has been sounding all afternoon (and possibly irritating your neighbours). However, smart alarms do require a hub that allows the various components to wirelessly connect. However for most clever alarms this hub can be put throughout your home.</p>

Watch on what matters by streaming your security camera on your TV using Google Nest or Home speaker or display and Chromecast or a TELEVISION with Chromecast built-in.</p>
