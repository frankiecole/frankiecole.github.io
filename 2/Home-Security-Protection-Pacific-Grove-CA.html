<p>So, while alarm might have some advantage for alarm owners as part of an overall security bundle, the question remains whether non-alarm owners in the neighborhood should carry a share of the cost. If alarm usage led to improved public safety-- that is, alarms resulted in much greater burglar apprehension rates or, preferably, fewer burglaries across a whole jurisdiction-- its public worth would be more apparent.

<p>Once the alarm company representative has made an appraisal of your security requires, ask him for a written proposition and a copy of the agreement you will have to sign.
