<p>3 big advantages of wireless security systems for occupants are their mobility, impermanence and expandability. Occupants, unlike house owners, normally prevent making irreversible changes to their homes.

On the other hand, wireless security utilizes equipment that's either freestanding or attached to walls and entranceways with removable adhesive. Wireless control panels, sensors and other components can easily be set up at different properties later, and wireless systems are quickly expanded with new parts too. Wireless security strategies also allow push-button control of the system and general home automation.
