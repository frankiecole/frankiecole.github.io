The latest Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is pricey, however it pumps images up to 4K resolution and has a fantastic daytime image.

We are confirming with Arlo whether our system was defective, and so we might revisit this evaluation. Basically, the Nest camera sits any place you put it and records what it sees, saving the last 5 days of video to the cloud.

<p>The NVR gets rid of these problems, because it is rather connected straight to a network. IP cameras that are connected to the same network, normally by way of a PoE switch, are then able to transmit video to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are a lot easier to scale up than DVR systems, just because they can accept a new camera once it is added to the network. In the worst case, all that would be needed is an additional PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can send footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no distance limitations so long as a camera is connected to the very same network as the NVR. The biggest drawback to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will deal with every NVR. So you'll need to understand whether your cameras will be compatible with an offered video recorder prior to purchasing.</p>
