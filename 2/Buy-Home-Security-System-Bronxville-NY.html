We recommend cellular systems since they're a lot more secure than landline systems, but there are some locations where cellular monitoring isn't readily available. A landline system is still much better than no security at all if you live someplace without access to cellular monitoring.</p>

But, if your web goes down, unfortunately, you will be without an alarm system up until it comes back up.</p>

We need to note that the camera would occasionally downgrade the image quality based on available bandwidth, which might vary throughout the day. Nest includes the alternative to set the bandwidth to low, medium, and high, but that may defeat the function of having a 1080p camera.</p>
