<p>Unlike the majority of other cameras we checked, the corded Circle 2 does not have level of sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ). Instead, you can filter event notices just by high activity, days, or person (the latter is readily available just with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more alerts, which you can just filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. The membership is more useful when utilized in high-traffic areas. Otherwise, the Smart Location feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent notifies every time you stroll by. Oddly, though the app supports multiple users, its geofencing uses to each user individually, so if everyone in your household has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notices when other people are home.</p>
