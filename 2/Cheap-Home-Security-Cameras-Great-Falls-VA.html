Although video surveillance was monitored out of necessity in the early days, nowadays it is a deliberate practice to improve the result of security systems.</p>

<h3>Alarm Systems For Business Great Falls VA 22066</h3>
<p>The growing existence of public cameras will bring subtle but extensive modifications to the character of our public areas. When residents are being watched by the authorities - or mindful they might be enjoyed at any time - they are more uneasy and less free-wheeling. As syndicated columnist Jacob Sullum has pointed out, "understanding that you are being watched by armed federal government agents tends to put a damper on things. You do not want to offend them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Eventually, he warns, "people may discover to be careful about the books and regulars they check out in public, preventing titles that might alarm unseen observers. They may also put more believed into how they dress, lest they look like terrorists, gang members, druggies or hookers."
