<p>Best Expert Installation Security Company - While some security systems offer easy DIY installation, other companies offer (and sometimes require) professional installation. Professional installation is offered for hardwired and wireless home security systems. Keep in mind that cameras with two-way audio generally work like walkie talkies.

Nevertheless, while 4K resolution offers some benefits, it also brings with it some disadvantages. 4K images are huge and take up a lot of taping storage area. So much, in reality, that they need about 4 times the hard disk drive area of 1080p to tape the very same length of video footage. If extended video storage is essential, be prepared to invest more money.</p>
