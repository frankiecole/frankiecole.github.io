<p>Unlike a lot of other cameras we evaluated, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ). Rather, you can filter event notices just by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is readily available just with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more notifies, which you can just filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. The membership is more useful when utilized in high-traffic locations. Otherwise, the Smart Place function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid alerts whenever you walk by.
