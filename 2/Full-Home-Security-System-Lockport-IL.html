<p>Developing a safe and secure  environment for a commercial or house is the responsibility of the whole community. Storage capability: For video recorders, the very first question you have to ask yourself is how much storage you will need. The response depends upon a couple of elements: the variety of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the amount of archived footage you mean to keep and how long you plan to keep recorded footage. If there are lots of cameras shooting in a greater resolution, the footage is going to consume storage space rapidly. You can set a video recorder to "overwrite" the earliest video footage once you reach the system's capacity, however if you're not mindful, the system may overwrite archived video footage that you still need.</p>
