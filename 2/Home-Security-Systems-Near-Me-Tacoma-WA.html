<p>Flood lights are frequently used in conjunction with motion detectors. When sensors identify motion, the lights light up the surrounding location, which will allow you to see who is on your residential or commercial property and will potentially scare off trespassers. Better outdoor lighting also suggests a clearer video for any outside cameras you have. When choosing flood lights, consider the brightness and range the light shines. Flood lights can hinder vandals or terrify them away, but as a single piece of equipment, they are more for your assurance than for home protection.</p>
