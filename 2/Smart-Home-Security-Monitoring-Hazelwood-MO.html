<p>I simply ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which permits you to modify the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this very crucial function. Also good metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Must be a much better method to carry out that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity at night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly advise.</p>
