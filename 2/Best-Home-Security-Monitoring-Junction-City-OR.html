<p>I simply finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which permits you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very essential function. Likewise good metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge selection gadget into the wall. Must be a much better way to implement that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity at night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly advise.</p>
