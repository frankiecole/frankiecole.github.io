<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent versus fraud, theft, and vandalism. Suggestion: Often keyholders are not available and the alarm does not reset. If the alarm is malfunctioning and reactivates, we must again react to the alarm; each response is billed. Having a keyholder offered to reset the alarm is one way of getting rid of pricey false alarms. For example, if the carbon monoxide gas levels increase past a certain level, you can make it automatically switch off the heating unit. You can automatically make the clever lights turn on to terrify away potential robbers if the motion sensors are set off.</p>
