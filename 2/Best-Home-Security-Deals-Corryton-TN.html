Now, the majority of security systems involve a great number of parts, such as a base station, security camera, glass, motion, and entry break sensing units, a keypad, and essential fobs, to name a few components.

Simplisafe does not consist of home automation functions, other than Nest combination, which might be a turn off for some.</p>
