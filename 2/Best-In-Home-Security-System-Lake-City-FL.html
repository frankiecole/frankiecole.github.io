For example, no other company can monitor a SimpliSafe, Cox, Brinks Home, or Xfinity Home system. These companies designed their equipment by doing this to make customers stay with them longer, because switching monitoring companies implies numerous dollars down the drain and a big headache for customers. How did they do it? They positioned 5 routers, DVRs and IP cameras on the open web. They were all running their latest software and firmware. According to the report, one gadget was hacked within a few minutes, while the rest were done and dusted within a day. They didn't say which gadget was the first, and the last to fall, however.</p>
