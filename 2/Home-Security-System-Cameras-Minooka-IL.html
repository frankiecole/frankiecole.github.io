<p>I simply completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to modify the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important function. Likewise nice metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get proper mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge selection gadget into the wall. Should be a much better method to execute that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness during the night. Ideally these hold up for many years! Highly suggest.</p>
