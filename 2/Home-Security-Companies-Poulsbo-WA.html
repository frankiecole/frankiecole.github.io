The cameras will be monitored by the Jefferson County Metro Area Crime Center The license plate acknowledgment camera data will be uploaded to the FBI's Wrongdoer Justice Info Services, and the city will get the content from the FBI's portal.

<p>Neither the light nor the camera is particularly outstanding on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's only 720p-- and we're starting to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that said, we would not suggest this system to tech-lovers, as we think the features are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home features. However if easy DIY installation, no-contracts, and affordable monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll enjoy SimpliSafe.</p>
