<p>The hermetically sealed reed switch is a really typical type of 2 piece sensor that runs with an electrically conductive reed switch that is either usually open or typically closed when under the impact of a magnetic field as in the case of proximity to the second piece which contains a magnet. When the magnet is moved far from the reed switch, the reed switch either closes or opens, again based upon whether the design is typically open or normally closed.
