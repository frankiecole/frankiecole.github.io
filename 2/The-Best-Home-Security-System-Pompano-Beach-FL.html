<p>In August 2019, the LockPickingLawyer YouTube channel posted a video demonstrating how to hack into a SimpliSafe system utilizing a $2 remote. When it detected any type of interference, SimpliSafe responded with a statement stating the system would inform users.

Over a week, we ran more than 25 tests using 2 various 433 MHz remotes, with contact sensors situated 6 to 26 feet far from the SimpliSafe Base Station, and we were not able to duplicate the issue. Although our screening should not be taken as conclusive, we believe this problem is unlikely to be a real-world issue for SimpliSafe customers who own the present system.</p>

<p>Whether you decide to go with a Do It Yourself system or choose a professionally installed system, you'll need to pay a monthly or yearly  cost if you require monitoring, and sometimes, you'll be struck with a regular monthly fee to settle the cost of hardware elements.

If you add monitoring, charges will vary: SimpliSafe charges $14.99 per month for its no-contract monitoring service, while Nest charges $29 monthly. The cost of the Nest service drops to $19 per month if you dedicate to a three-year agreement. Ring's Protect Plus plan opts for $10 each month and does not need an agreement.</p>
