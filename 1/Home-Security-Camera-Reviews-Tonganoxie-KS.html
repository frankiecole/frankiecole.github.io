The most recent Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is expensive, however it pumps images up to 4K resolution and has a fantastic daytime image. In our testing, however, we found the motion sensor to be sensitive, with terrible night-vision performance, and wonky tracking and bad battery life to boot. We are verifying with Arlo whether our unit was malfunctioning, and so we might review this review.
