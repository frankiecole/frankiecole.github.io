Storage capacity: For video recorders, the very first question you have to ask yourself is just how much storage you will need. The answer hinges on a number of factors: the number of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the amount of archived video you intend to store and the length of time you prepare to keep documented footage. If there are lots of cameras shooting in a higher resolution, the video is going to consume storage space rapidly.
