Salt Lake City requires verification from a personal security personnel. A number of cities also need a license to even own and operate a home security system. Guidelines such as these are designed to limit the time and resources that authorities and fire departments waste on incorrect alarms. Many municipalities will fine you for a lot of false alarms.</p>
