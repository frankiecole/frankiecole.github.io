<p>Simply bought a bullet ip system and definitely enjoy it. Great clearness. I wished to establish viewing on my mobile phone however had a couple questions that the tech answered with ease. I Would definitely purchase from cctvsecuritypros again. I extremely suggest this company. The Nest Aware service is what makes this camera stick out-- it's what supplies the video history and smarter alerts, for example. Nevertheless, those functions come at a comparatively high price: $5 per month ($50 per year) for the first camera for 5 days of video history, $10 monthly ($100 each year) for 10 days of video history, or $30 per month ($300 each year) for 30 days of video history.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not fantastic-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the price of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 provides no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just by means of a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we found to have horrible night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far too many motion sets off.</p>
