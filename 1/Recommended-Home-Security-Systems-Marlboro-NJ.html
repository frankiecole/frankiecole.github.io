These security cameras link to a user's home wifi network and allows that user to see the video footage from anywhere. A typical misconception is that wireless implies the camera is wire-free. This is not the case as wireless cameras might still require a power cable. Wired security cameras are linked to a recorder directly which then connects to a router and the web. Finally, wire-free cameras are entirely cable complimentary and battery powered.
