<p>Video surveillance monitoring is as old as the very principle of camera surveillance. Video surveillance has actually come a long way, spanning numerous decades. The very first video surveillance system was a Closed-Circuit Tv (CCTV) installed in 1942 by German scientists to monitor the launch of rockets. The technology gradually progressed into the extremely advanced yet economical systems readily available today. The first usages of CCTV cameras required monitoring the feed in real-time - i.e., they did not have the methods to record video and see it later. Although video surveillance was monitored out of requirement in the early days, nowadays it is a deliberate practice to enhance the result of security systems.</p>

We have actually seen 1-year, all the way up to 5-year agreements! On the other hand, we advise contract-free systems if you don't want to sign on the dotted line and be locked into a long-term agreement (and who does?). Our choice: No contract.</p>
