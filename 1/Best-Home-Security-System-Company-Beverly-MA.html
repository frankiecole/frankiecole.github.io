Thankfully, you're not doing anything prohibited, just reading this book, and hopefully not behind the wheel of a getaway cars and truck, idling in front of a neighborhood bank or terrorist target, or speeding through a traffic signal at a high-risk intersection.</p>
<p>Video surveillance monitoring is as old as the extremely principle of camera surveillance. Video surveillance has come a long way, spanning a number of years. The first video surveillance system was a Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) installed in 1942 by German researchers to monitor the launch of rockets. The innovation slowly evolved into the extremely advanced yet cost effective systems offered today. The very first usages of CCTV cameras required monitoring the feed in real-time - i.e., they did not have the means to record video and enjoy it later. Although video surveillance was monitored out of need in the early days, nowadays it is an intentional practice to enhance the outcome of security systems.</p>
<p>In its truest type, a CCTV camera is an analog video camera that transfers signals via coaxial cable to a single central area for recording, video, and monitoring analysis.

In 2001, more than 75 percent of the dispatched alarm calls for fire action were deemed false, unintentional, or a system malfunction. Historically the costs of these actions have been paid by the City's general fund.
