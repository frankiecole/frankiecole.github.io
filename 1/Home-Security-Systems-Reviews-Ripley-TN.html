<p>The growing existence of public cameras will bring profound but subtle changes to the character of our public spaces. When residents are being seen by the authorities - or aware they may be viewed at any time - they are more uncomfortable and less free-wheeling. As syndicated columnist Jacob Sullum has actually explained, "understanding that you are being enjoyed by armed federal government representatives tends to deter things. You don't want to upset them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Eventually, he alerts, "people might find out to be careful about the books and regulars they read in public, avoiding titles that may alarm hidden observers. They might likewise put more thought into how they dress, lest they look like terrorists, gang members, hookers or druggies."
