<p>The growing presence of public cameras will bring subtle however extensive changes to the character of our public spaces.

As syndicated columnist Jacob Sullum has actually pointed out, "understanding that you are being seen by armed government representatives tends to put a damper on things. You do not wish to offend them or otherwise call attention to yourself."
