<p>So, while alarm systems may have some advantage for alarm owners as part of a general security bundle, the question stays whether non-alarm owners in the community need to shoulder a share of the cost. If alarm use resulted in boosted public safety-- that is, alarms resulted in much higher burglar apprehension rates or, ideally, less thefts throughout an entire jurisdiction-- its public value would be more evident. However, the fact that alarm calls are extremely incorrect and do not contribute considerably to police capability to apprehend intruders makes the underwriting of alarm response by authorities and entire communities (all taxpayers support cops reaction to alarmed residential or commercial properties) a ineffective and pricey approach to burglary decrease across a whole jurisdiction.</p>
