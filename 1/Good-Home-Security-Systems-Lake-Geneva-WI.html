<p>I simply finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really important feature. Likewise nice metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Need to be a much better method to execute that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness at night. Ideally these hold up over the years! Highly suggest.</p>
