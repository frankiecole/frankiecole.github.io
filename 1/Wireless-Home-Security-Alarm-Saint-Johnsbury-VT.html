Another area where Arlo stands out is customer care.

<p>The real factor cameras are usually deployed is to minimize much pettier crimes. However it has actually not even been demonstrated that they can do that. In Britain, where cameras have been extensively released in public locations, sociologists studying the concern have discovered that they have actually not decreased criminal offense. "When the crime and offense figures were gotten used to take account of the general downward trend in crimes and offences," criminologists found in one study, "reductions were kept in mind in specific categories but there was no proof to suggest that the cameras had minimized crime overall in the city centre." A 2005 study for the British Home Office also found that cameras did not cut crime or the worry of criminal offense (as had a 2002 study, also for the British federal government).</p>
