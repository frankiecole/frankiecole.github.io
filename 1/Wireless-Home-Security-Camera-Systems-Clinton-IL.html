The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to modify the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this really important feature. Likewise great metal building and construction.

Must be a better way to carry out that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness during the night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly suggest.</p>
