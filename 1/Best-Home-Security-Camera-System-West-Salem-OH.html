<p>So, while alarm might have some benefit for alarm owners as part of an overall security package, the concern remains whether non-alarm owners in the community should carry a share of the cost. If alarm usage led to enhanced public safety-- that is, alarms led to much higher burglar apprehension rates or, preferably, less robberies across a whole jurisdiction-- its public value would be more evident.

The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's just 720p-- and we're beginning to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry.

For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home features.
