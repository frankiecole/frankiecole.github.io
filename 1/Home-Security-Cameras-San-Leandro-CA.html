How did they do it? They put five routers, DVRs and IP cameras on the open web. They were all running their latest software application and firmware. According to the report, one gadget was hacked within a few minutes, while the rest were done and dusted within a day. They didn't state which device was the first, and the last to fall, however.</p>

In the worst case, all that would be needed is an extra PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can transfer video footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no proximity constraints so long as a camera is linked to the very same network as the NVR. The biggest downside to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will deal with every NVR.
