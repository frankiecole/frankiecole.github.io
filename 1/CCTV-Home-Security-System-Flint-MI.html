<p>There are two primary kinds of cameras that can be wired into a video surveillance system: web protocol (IP) cameras and the conventional analog cameras. IP cameras are the more modern version of analog cameras, and while the individual cameras tend to be a bit more costly, they provide a variety of features that analog cameras do not. Here's a take a look at the distinctions in between the two types of camera. Today's wireless home security systems are more steady than they utilized to be.
