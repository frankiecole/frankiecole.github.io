<p>Discover how to design, construct, and install commercial grade security camera systems to increase staff member safety and minimize criminal activity. The latest Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is expensive, however it pumps images up to 4K resolution and has an excellent daytime image. In our screening, however, we found the motion sensing unit to be sensitive, with awful night-vision performance, and wonky tracking and poor battery life to boot. We are validating with Arlo whether our unit was malfunctioning, and so we may review this review.
