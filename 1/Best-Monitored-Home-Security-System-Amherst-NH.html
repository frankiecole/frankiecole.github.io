<p>The growing presence of public cameras will bring profound but subtle modifications to the character of our public spaces. When citizens are being watched by the authorities - or aware they might be viewed at any time - they are more awkward and less free-wheeling. As syndicated columnist Jacob Sullum has mentioned, "knowing that you are being watched by armed federal government agents tends to put a damper on things. You don't wish to upset them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Ultimately, he alerts, "individuals may learn to be cautious about the books and periodicals they read in public, avoiding titles that may alarm unseen observers. They may likewise put more believed into how they dress, lest they appear like terrorists, gang members, hookers or drug addicts."
