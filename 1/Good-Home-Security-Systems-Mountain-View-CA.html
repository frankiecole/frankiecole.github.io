<p>There ought to be a clear line of vision in between wireless transceivers, so that each camera can see" the home structure to send video. We attempted each of the cameras in several places around our house, ranging from 6 feet to 30 feet away from our Wi-Fi router, which was linked to Verizon Fios service. When possible, we evaluated each camera using an iOS gadget (an iPhone 7 and an iPad) along with an Android smartphone (utilizing a Nokia 3.1 running Android 9 Pie).
