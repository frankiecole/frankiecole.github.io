<p>You can discover 2 types of security systems: expertly monitored and unmonitored.

That indicates you need to be on call, day and night, throughout work and vacation time, and all set to figure out whether authorities, fire departments, or other emergency situation services need to be dispatched. Then, you need to make that call yourself. It's a big difference, and a professionally monitored system is basically more secure than a self-monitored or unmonitored one.</p>

We have actually seen 1-year, all the method up to 5-year contracts! On the other hand, we suggest contract-free systems if you don't want to sign on the dotted line and be locked into a long-lasting agreement (and who does?). Our choice: No agreement.</p>
