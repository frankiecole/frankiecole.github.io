<p>I simply finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to modify the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial feature. Also good metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get appropriate mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge selection gadget into the wall. Need to be a much better way to carry out that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity during the night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly recommend.</p>
