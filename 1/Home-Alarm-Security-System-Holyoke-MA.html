<p>The Wisenet SmartCam N2 provides complimentary perks like individual detection, familiar-face signals, and local storage on a microSD card. (Cloud storage begins at $5 monthly.) However, in our tests the familiar-face alerts worked only about 50 percent of the time and the camera routinely detached from the network several times a day (when everything else on our network appeared fine). The app was likewise painfully slow when we accessed live streams and tape-recorded clips, along with when we made changes in the settings.</p>
