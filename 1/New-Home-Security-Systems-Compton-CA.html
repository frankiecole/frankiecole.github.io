<h3>Outdoor Surveillance Camera Compton CA 90221</h3>
<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don. We have actually found that battery life never matches the maker's stats since this comes from tests in a regulated environment without constant video recording, which is the most significant offender for brief battery life without a doubt. We concur with you about Blink's superior battery life over on our outdoor security camera evaluation, but its recording capability is a bit minimal to recommend as a top pick.</p>

Naturally, at that point, the cheap price becomes more costly.</p>
