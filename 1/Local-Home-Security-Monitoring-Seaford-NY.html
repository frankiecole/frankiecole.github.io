<p>Developing a secure and safe environment for a commercial or home is the duty of the entire community. Storage capability: For video recorders, the first question you need to ask yourself is how much storage you will need. The answer depends upon a couple of factors: the variety of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the amount of archived video you mean to keep and the length of time you prepare to keep documented footage. If there are lots of cameras shooting in a greater resolution, the video is going to eat up storage space quickly. You can set a video recorder to "overwrite" the oldest video footage once you reach the system's capability, but if you're not careful, the system may overwrite archived video that you still need.</p>
