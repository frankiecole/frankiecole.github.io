The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which permits you to modify the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential function. Also great metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial choice gadget into the wall. Should be a better way to carry out that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity during the night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly advise.</p>
