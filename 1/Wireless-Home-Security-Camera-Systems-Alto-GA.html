<p>Another crucial subject to discuss is camera resolution. It can be puzzling to comprehend just how much is enough. In this post, the term resolution" describes the number of dots (pixels) that comprise a video photo; the more dots, the more detailed the video image. The same holds true of high-resolution TV sets, and the two most popular TV resolutions today are 1080p and 4K. 4K resolution consists of about 4 times as much picture details as 1080p. Surveillance cameras are also produced in these two resolutions, and it would be natural to believe that the more dots in your video image the much better, right? Yes and no. When it pertains to surveillance cameras, there are some tricky effects to having such a high-resolution 4K image. In this case, more is not always better.</p>
