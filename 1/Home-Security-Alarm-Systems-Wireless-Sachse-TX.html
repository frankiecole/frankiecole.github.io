I have actually had their doorbell for a year - never an issue. And their cameras are better priced than any others. With clear, HD video - day or night - it's simple to sign in on the kids; 2- and four-legged alike. Rugged Web cams constructs security cameras for businesses of any size - from Mom & Pop shops to Fortune 500 industries.</p>
<p>We still recommend SimpliSafe general due to the fact that it has a broader variety of equipment and much better cameras. But Cove is a great alternative for individuals who want something economical yet smooth. Every company is various.
