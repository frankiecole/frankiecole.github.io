However suicide assailants are clearly not hindered by camera - and may even be brought in to the tv protection cameras can make sure - and the cost of an extensive video surveillance system such as Britain's - which sucks up around 20 percent of that nation's criminal justice spending plan - far surpasses the restricted benefits that the system might supply in examining attacks or tried attacks after the fact (see fact sheet on Surveillance Cameras and the Attempted London Attacks ).</p>

<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with a special light-handling function. These cameras use both a software and hardware service called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range".

As far as anyone is worried, the image looks totally regular considering that the entrance and space seem at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the goal of recording video of everybody getting in the shop.
