Due to the fact that their design enables for minimum glare, bullet cameras tend to be among the most popular outdoor alternatives.

<p>The problem with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and sometimes, the real lens.

Inside, these gadgets have a far longer life span, but outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without environment control, a lot of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the harsh environment.</p>
