<p>The rest of the field is more specialized, accommodating innovative wise home connoisseurs or fans of a specific ecosytem of items. Nest's Secure has the very best style of any system I checked, including smart things like incorporating the keypad and a motion detector into the base station and integrating motion detectors and entry sensors into one system.
