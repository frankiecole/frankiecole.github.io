<p>If you have an interest in a 4K camera system, you preferably will have a really high-speed Internet connection and a robust home network, preferably an enterprise-grade network. As talked about above, the 4K camera images are huge, and that is a lot of data to push around the home's network and optionally, to an offsite cloud recording service (more on that listed below). Rely on your HTA Certified technology expert for recommendations here, as they will have the ability to determine if a 4K camera system will work in your circumstance.

<p>Neither the camera nor the light is particularly remarkable on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's just 720p-- and we're starting to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that said, we wouldn't recommend this system to tech-lovers, as we think the features are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home functions. However if easy Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and low-cost monitoring is your thing, we think you'll enjoy SimpliSafe.</p>
