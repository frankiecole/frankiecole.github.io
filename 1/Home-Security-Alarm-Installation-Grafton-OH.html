<p>I just finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to tweak the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential feature. Likewise great metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big choice gadget into the wall. Must be a much better way to carry out that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness at night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Extremely suggest.</p>
