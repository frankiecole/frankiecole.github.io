A thermal camera consists of a heat sensing unit that is capable of finding tiny differences in temperature level. The device collects the infrared radiation from objects in the scene and produces an electronic image based on information about the temperature distinctions.

Some, like our existing top security camera recommendation the Arlo Ultra, increase from that to provide 4K resolution.</p>
<p>I just ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to tweak the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very essential feature. Also nice metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get correct mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big choice gadget into the wall. Need to be a much better method to execute that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity during the night. Ideally these hold up for many years! Highly recommend.</p>
