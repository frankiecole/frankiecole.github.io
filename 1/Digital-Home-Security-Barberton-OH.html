<p>The issue with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and sometimes, the real lens. After a couple of years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it challenging for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to successfully translate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these devices have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without climate control, a number of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the harsh environment.</p>

<p>This clever smart alarm has a motion detector and siren in one device. During screening, we discovered it was simple to arm and disarm and the motion detection was accurate, with the siren rapidly triggering when movement was found. We love that it also lets you understand when other alarms are going off, such as a smoke or CO2 detector. For a lot of homes, you'll require numerous Minuts throughout your property, which can get expensive.
