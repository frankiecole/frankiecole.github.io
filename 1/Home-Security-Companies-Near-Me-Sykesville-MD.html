<p>Another important topic to talk about is camera resolution. It can be puzzling to comprehend how much suffices. In this post, the term resolution" refers to the number of dots (pixels) that make up a video picture; the more dots, the more detailed the video image. The same holds true of high-resolution Television Set, and the two most popular TV resolutions today are 1080p and 4K. 4K resolution includes about 4 times as much image details as 1080p. Surveillance cameras are also produced in these 2 resolutions, and it would be natural to believe that the more dots in your video image the much better, right? Yes and no. When it concerns surveillance cameras, there are some difficult repercussions to having such a high-resolution 4K image. In this case, more is not always much better.</p>
