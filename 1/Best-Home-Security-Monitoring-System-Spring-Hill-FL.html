<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent versus theft, vandalism, and scams. Suggestion: Typically keyholders are not available and the alarm does not reset.

<p>The problem with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in some cases, the actual lens. After a few years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it tough for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to successfully equate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these gadgets have a far longer life span, but outdoors, or even in a garage without environment control, a number of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the harsh environment.</p>

<p>When utilizing IP cameras - as the majority of CCTV systems do these days - you will probably be taking a look at Cat5E or Cat6 cable televisions, which can transfer the big quantity of information required by digital video and high resolutions at very quick speeds, and frequently over fars away. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that generally powers analog security cameras; coax cable televisions are reputable, but not compatible with IP cameras. In many cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will likewise power the security cameras, getting rid of the requirement for additional circuitry.

Wireless security cameras might need less electrical wiring in the walls but will still need cable televisions to power the security camera individually, generally through 110VAC power.</p>
