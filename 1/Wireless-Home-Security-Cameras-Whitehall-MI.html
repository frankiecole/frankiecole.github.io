<p>CR's take: The Wyze Webcam V2 is a great security camera and an extraordinary value. It receives an Excellent rating for video quality and is easier to use than the other cameras on this list. It likewise does well in our privacy and security tests. The camera features a rolling 14 days of complimentary storage for motion-trigged video clips, individual detection, voice control via Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and the ability to keep video footage in your area on an SD card. Unlike the other cameras on this list, Wyze does not use paid subscription plans for extra cloud storage.

Without an sd or the service card for local storage, the camera stops recording after 12 seconds.</p>
<p>This awesome clever alarm has a motion detector and siren in one device. Throughout testing, we discovered it was basic to arm and deactivate and the motion detection was precise, with the siren rapidly triggering when motion was spotted. We like that it also lets you know when other alarms are going off, such as a smoke or CO2 detector. For many homes, you'll require several Minuts throughout your home, which can get expensive. It's also worth keeping in mind that it has to be set up on the ceiling (it just keeps track of for motion in the 25m squared listed below), which is fiddly. It also had the quietest alarm of all that we checked and there's no external monitoring service offered.</p>
