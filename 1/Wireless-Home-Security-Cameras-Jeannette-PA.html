<p>Establishing a safe and secure  environment for a commercial or residential property is the responsibility of the whole community. Storage capability: For video recorders, the first concern you need to ask yourself is just how much storage you will require. The response hinges on a number of aspects: the number of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the quantity of archived video you mean to store and how long you plan to keep recorded video footage. If there are many cameras shooting in a higher resolution, the video is going to consume storage space quickly. You can set a video recorder to "overwrite" the oldest video once you reach the system's capacity, however if you're not mindful, the system may overwrite archived footage that you still require.</p>

Systems based around an NVR are much easier to scale up than DVR systems, simply since they can accept a new camera once it is contributed to the network. In the worst case, all that would be needed is an additional PoE switch. Some IP cameras are likewise wireless and can transmit footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi.
