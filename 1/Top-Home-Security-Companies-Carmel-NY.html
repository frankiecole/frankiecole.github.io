<p>I just finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very crucial feature. Likewise good metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge selection device into the wall. Should be a much better way to implement that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity during the night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Extremely advise.</p>
<p>If you hold down the panic or fire alarm buttons on the alarm system touchpad for 1 to 3 seconds, an alarm is transmitted to the ADT monitoring center, and emergency situation services are dispatched instantly.

House owners selecting a system must look for a trustworthy, reputable company. Many of the best security companies have remained in the home security business for decades, long before the concept of self-monitored systems even existed. Credible companies tend to have much better equipment and customer care also.</p>
