<p>The growing presence of public cameras will bring profound but subtle modifications to the character of our public spaces. When residents are being seen by the authorities - or aware they might be seen at any time - they are more awkward and less free-wheeling. As syndicated writer Jacob Sullum has pointed out, "knowing that you are being viewed by armed federal government representatives tends to deter things. You do not wish to upset them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Eventually, he cautions, "people may learn to be cautious about the books and regulars they read in public, avoiding titles that might alarm unseen observers. They might likewise put more thought into how they dress, lest they appear like terrorists, gang members, hookers or druggies." Certainly, the research studies of cameras in Britain found that people deemed to be "out of time and location" with the surroundings went through prolonged surveillance.</p>
