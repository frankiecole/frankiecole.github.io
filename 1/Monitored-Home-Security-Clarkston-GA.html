<p>DITEK's alarm system rise protectors protect your security system against short-term rises that can go into through Air Conditioning power lines, telephone lines and remote notification zones. Home automation is simple and practical, and wireless systems help you automate your home that a lot easier.

<p>CCTV cameras are positioned in areas where they are believed to be most efficient, which generally consists of extremely inhabited towns, city centers, parking area, or various other high-crime areas (Welsh and Farrington 2008).

In numerous cases, Geographic Details Systems technology is utilized to specifically assess criminal activity patterns for camera positioning; nevertheless, the placement of cameras can likewise be the outcome of input from law enforcement officer and other criminal justice stakeholders (La Vigne et al. 2011).</p>
