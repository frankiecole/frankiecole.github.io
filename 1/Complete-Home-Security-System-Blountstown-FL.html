When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 offers no totally free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, only by means of a computer.

<p>So, while alarm may have some benefit for alarm owners as part of a general security bundle, the question stays whether non-alarm owners in the neighborhood must take on a share of the cost. If alarm usage led to improved public safety-- that is, alarms caused much greater burglar apprehension rates or, ideally, fewer break-ins across an entire jurisdiction-- its public value would be more apparent. However, the fact that alarm calls are overwhelmingly incorrect and do not contribute significantly to authorities capability to apprehend robbers makes the underwriting of alarm action by cops and entire communities (all taxpayers support police reaction to alarmed properties) a ineffective and expensive method to robbery reduction across an entire jurisdiction.</p>
