Occupants, unlike house owners, generally avoid making long-term changes to their homes. Hardwired security systems for that reason aren't practical; they involve drilling into walls and setting up permanent electrical circuits. On the other hand, wireless security uses equipment that's either freestanding or attached to walls and entranceways with removable adhesive. Wireless control panels, sensors and other parts can quickly be established at different properties later, and wireless systems are easily broadened with new elements too.

Seismic glass-break detectors feel these shock frequencies and in turn produce an alarm condition.</p>
