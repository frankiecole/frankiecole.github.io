<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not great-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the rate of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching.

Both are still better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we found to have horrible night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a propensity to miss far too many motion activates.</p>
