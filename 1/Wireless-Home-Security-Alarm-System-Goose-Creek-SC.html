<p>No incorrect alarm charges: Property owners with a self-monitored system are less most likely to dispatch the authorities for an incorrect alarm. Because the house owner is in charge of the system, authorities are only gotten in touch with if there's a real emergency situation. On the other hand, a professional monitoring company will call police if a homeowner can't confirm a false alarm. , if cops are contacted for an incorrect alarm, house owners may need to pay a fine for dispatching police needlessly.
