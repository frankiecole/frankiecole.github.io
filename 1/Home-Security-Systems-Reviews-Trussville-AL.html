Top quality, strategically positioned residential security cameras enable property owners to keep watch over their homes at all times.

<p>There's no dedicated hub involved here - each camera connects straight to your router via Wi-Fi, and streams to your phone (or to the outside world) from there.

In the worst case, all that would be needed is an extra PoE switch. Some IP cameras are likewise wireless and can transfer video to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no proximity constraints so long as a camera is connected to the same network as the NVR.
