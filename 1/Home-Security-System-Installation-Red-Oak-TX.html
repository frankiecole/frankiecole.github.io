IP cameras work by utilizing an IP (IP stands for internet procedure) network, often the very same data network the rest of a company uses. If bandwidth is a problem, a different network using classification 5 electrical wiring can be utilized. Either way, video info is recorded on a server, which indicates video information can be located on site or in a remote location. After testing, we sent out each of our top choices, along with the Wyze Webcam v2, to Bill McKinley, head of details security at The New York Times (Wirecutter's parent company), for hack testing.
