When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching.

We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy.

<p>The motion detection is excellent, and the app is a pleasure to utilize as well (a lot much better than the apps you get with some budget plan security cameras), though if you want to enter into its cleverest customisations, there is a little a knowing curve. For even more basic smarts, it's excellent, though.
