We like that the system consists of a wifi security camera and only alerts you when motion is created by something with the exact same heat pattern as a human (ensuring there's no false notifies). Nevertheless, you do require to sign up for the external monitoring service (from ₤ 12.99 monthly) to be able to see recording from the wifi security camera and get signals on your phone if the sensing units have actually been activated. There's no external alarm either. Other packages are available that have essential fobs and additional sensing units, too.</p>
