<p>Unlike a lot of other cameras we evaluated, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ).

Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more informs, which you can just filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. When used in high-traffic areas, the membership is more helpful. Otherwise, the Smart Place function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid informs every time you stroll by. Strangely, though the app supports numerous users, its geofencing uses to each user individually, so if everybody in your family has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notices when other people are home.</p>
