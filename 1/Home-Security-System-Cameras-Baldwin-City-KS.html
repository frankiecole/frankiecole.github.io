<p>I just ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to modify the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very important function. Likewise good metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge choice device into the wall. Should be a much better method to execute that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity at night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Extremely recommend.</p>
