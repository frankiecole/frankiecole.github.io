Although some companies supply heavily reduced or complimentary hardware in exchange for a service commitment that can last anywhere from one to five years, we discovered no-contract systems to be the most versatile. Some individuals might wish to sign up for service just for when they or their partner runs out town, for example. No-contract systems likewise cost less in the long run and enable you to be in overall control of the equipment you utilize, as well as how and when you pay and use for monitoring services.</p>
