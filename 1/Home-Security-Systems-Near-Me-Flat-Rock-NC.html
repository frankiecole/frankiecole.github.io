<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with an unique light-handling function. These cameras use both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety".

As a result, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of capturing video of everybody getting in the store. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Sadly, once customers understand that the affordable customer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's normally far too late since the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
