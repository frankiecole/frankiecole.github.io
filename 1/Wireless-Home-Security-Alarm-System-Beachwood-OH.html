For example, no other company can monitor a SimpliSafe, Cox, Brinks Home, or Xfinity Home system. These companies created their equipment by doing this to make customers stay with them longer, since changing monitoring companies implies hundreds of dollars down the drain and a huge headache for customers. How did they do it? They put 5 routers, DVRs and IP cameras on the open web. They were all running their newest software and firmware.
