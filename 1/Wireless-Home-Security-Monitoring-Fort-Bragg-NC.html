<h3>Alarm Systems For Homes Wireless Fort Bragg NC 28307</h3>
<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don. We have actually discovered that battery life never matches the maker's stats given that this originates from tests in a regulated environment without continuous video recording, which is the biggest offender for short battery life without a doubt.
