<p>The Nest Webcam Outdoor's 1080p images and sound were excellent in our testing-- throughout the day and during the night-- with a large, 130-degree field of vision and 8 x digital zoom that permitted us to get a closer view in live video. We ought to keep in mind that the camera would occasionally downgrade the photo quality based on available bandwidth, which could change throughout the day.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not terrific-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the rate of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 uses no free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only through a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we found to have dreadful night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss far too many motion triggers.</p>
