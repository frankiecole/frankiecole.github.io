<p>We installed our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside your home so we could point them at the very same area and expose them all to the same lighting conditions and New England weather. The exceptions were cameras that were incorporated into outdoor lighting components, which I had actually installed on the patio by a licensed electrical contractor (who takes place to be my husband). All of the cameras were linked to the very same 2.4 GHz network through a Wi-Fi router indoors (approximately 40 feet from the cameras); service to your home was Verizon Fios.</p>
