However, while 4K resolution uses some benefits, it likewise brings with it some disadvantages. 4K images are large and use up a lot of recording storage space. So much, in reality, that they require about four times the disk drive space of 1080p to tape the exact same length of video footage. If extended video storage is crucial, be prepared to spend more money.</p>
<p>Another essential topic to talk about is camera resolution. It can be confusing to comprehend just how much suffices. In this post, the term resolution" describes the number of dots (pixels) that make up a video photo; the more dots, the more in-depth the video image.

Surveillance cameras are also produced in these two resolutions, and it would be natural to think that the more dots in your video image the better, right? Yes and no. When it pertains to surveillance cameras, there are some difficult effects to having such a high-resolution 4K image. In this case, more is not constantly much better.</p>
