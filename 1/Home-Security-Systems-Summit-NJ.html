We love that the system consists of a wifi security camera and only notifies you when motion is created by something with the same heat pattern as a human (making sure there's no false alerts). However, you do need to subscribe to the external monitoring service (from â‚¤ 12.99 each month) to be able to view recording from the wifi security camera and get alerts on your phone if the sensors have been activated.

If the system worked any other way, it would incorrect alarm whenever you walked into a safeguarded room.</p>
