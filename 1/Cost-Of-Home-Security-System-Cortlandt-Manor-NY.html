<p>Discover how to design, build, and install commercial grade security camera systems to increase worker safety and minimize criminal activity. The current Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is expensive, however it pumps images up to 4K resolution and has a terrific daytime image. In our screening, however, we discovered the motion sensor to be sensitive, with dreadful night-vision efficiency, and wonky tracking and bad battery life to boot.

SimpliSafe is not great at smart home assistance. It deals with Amazon Alexa, and it offers its own smart door lock, but you can't go setting up many third-party gadgets with your SimpliSafe system.

<p>We like the 10-piece Alarm Security Package because it includes all the fundamentals (base station, keypad, motion sensing unit) plus a few extra entry sensing units.
