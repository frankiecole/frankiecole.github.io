<p>I just finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which permits you to modify the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial feature. Likewise good metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big choice device into the wall. Need to be a better way to execute that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker.
