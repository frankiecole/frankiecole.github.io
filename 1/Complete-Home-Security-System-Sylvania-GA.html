They use flexibility in their equipment and offered strategies, allowing property owners to select the security service that best matches their needs. Regrettably, there are some drawbacks to Protect America suggested by their low C- score from BBB. A bulk of the grievances center around misinformation regarding the obligatory three year contract. In truth, the majority of consumers were not aware they were making such a long term dedication. This, coupled with the serious charge for early cancellation-100% of the remaining balance plus spending for all of the equipment-may provide some pause in selecting Protect America as their home security service.</p>

<p>The rest of Nest's security equipment is high-quality, if not particularly cutting-edge, so we're really advising the security cameras here. Some small-business owners will also like Nest's contract-free strategy alternative. Sure, you get a lower rate if you go with a three-year contract, but given that Nest needs you to pay 100% of your staying agreement if you cancel, it's a huge dedication. So pick what will be the much better offer for you. Go with the contract and gain those savings if you know you'll stay put for at least three years. But if you might update to a new office with different security needs, contract-free is your best option.</p>
