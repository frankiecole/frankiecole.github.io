<p>No matter what kind of alarm you have, many burglar alarms work the precise same method. They use open and closed circuits to transfer an electrical existing. When this electrical current is not being transferred it sets off a burglar alarm. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is transferred when the doors are shut. Which indicates if the doors are shut electrical current can be moved throughout the circuits. If someone were to open the door that would suggest that the electrical current can no longer be moved, which would then set off the alarm system.
