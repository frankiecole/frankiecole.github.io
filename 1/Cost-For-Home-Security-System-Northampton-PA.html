In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and an exposure of the doorway and then integrates the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 areas. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks completely normal because the entrance and room appear to be at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the goal of recording video of everyone going into the store.
